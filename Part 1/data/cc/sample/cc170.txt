RetroVision is capturing the electronic music world by storm. His tracks regularly get featured on game-changing playlists like Spotify’s mint, and major YouTube & SoundCloud curators like Future House Music, MrSuicideSheep or xKito are spreading the buzz. Needless to say, his releases stack up millions and millions of streams.We invited RetroVision to an in-depth interview that spreads from the beginning of his career to his latest release. Here’s what the 22 year old DJ, producer and remixer from France had to say …I always loved making music even when I was a child, I was playing “Music” which was a PS1 music creation game! My biggest influence is Skrillex for sure, I always loved his stuff since I started making music.My production techniques! Also I don’t produce the same genre at all (I used to produce trap music back in the days). I learned a lot by watching tutorials so that made my sound evolve and also made it more unique.Music curators on YouTube & SoundCloud are a great way to get discovered, especially when you can’t / don’t sign your music on labels already. Some of them also offer label services, but it’s definitely a great way to start and get promoted to a wide audience. It helped me a lot to grow my name.I think Spotify has completely changed my life. My actual main revenue is coming from those streaming services and I think today you have to push your music to get playlisted because playlists are the way to get promoted on these services. Only issue is that I won’t probably ever sell any CD’s, but well we have to evolve someday!I actually work with a serious team now which is Hexagon (Don Diablo’s label & management), and they are helping me to sign my music on bigger imprints. I actually did one self release last year and I’m still amazed that it was my most listened track on Spotify during few months, it got more than 3 million streams so that was a bit random but super happy about it knowing I didn’t do any promotion about it!You have to read your contracts carefully because you might get stuck somewhere because of some points you forgot to read! No one knows!I have a sort of routine during the soundcheck, I test the Dj decks and mixer, test the booth speakers and even talk with the LJ (Light Jockey), and my tour manager helps me on everything so there is no troubles during the show. We also have a technical rider so the venue is usually prepared for the show already.It depends! Most of the time I start by writing chords and then add a melody etc… But sometimes I start with a drop idea I randomly get and then I build the track around it.ForTunes, because your app is freaking awesome! Also Filterloop Pro because it allows me to make quick pictures edits when I’m on a rush, and Spotify For Artists for music stats on the go!I love stats. I think pretty much everyone does, but it affects me when I’m hesitating on what to post, makes me think about the content I could create and things I could do to grow my project. But also it keeps me motivated when I see the numbers and then I work even harder.Listen to RetroVision’s latest release “House Beat” and make sure to follow him:InstagramSpotifyYouTubeFacebookTwitter  commentsYour email address will not be published.
