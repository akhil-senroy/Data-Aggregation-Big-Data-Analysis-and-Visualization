Stockholm based producer Robin Tayger is stepping up to bring back the realness of making house music. His tracks – influenced by the classic Swedish house sound – already got support from big artists like Martin Garrix & Felix Jaehn.We had a chat with Robin about his upcoming as an artist, the realities of producing music in the digital age and his latest single “Thinkin'”. I actually got into making music at a really young age. When I was 11 years old, the likes of Swedish House Mafia and Avicii became huge in Sweden (this was also the time EDM blew up). Around this time I can remember looking at a Swedish House Mafia masterclass of how “One” was made, and at that moment I knew what I wanted to do. For Christmas that year I got Logic Pro 9 and my first MIDI keyboard, and from then on I’ve been hooked! Since then my sound has evolved and become deeper, but my piano melodies and chord progressions are still heavily influenced by the classic Swedish house sound and I think that is what in some way makes my music unique!Even though I’ve been producing since 2011, things have only really started to pick up in the last year or so (after I changed to my current artist name ‘Robin Tayger’). Last year I signed away my first tracks to some really cool record labels (Gameroom, BMKLTSCH, FRQNCY), and I also hit a million plays on all my songs across all platforms which I never expected. I’m also happy about the major support I got last year; to get support from superstars like Martin Garrix, Don Diablo, Kaskade and labels like Spinnin’ Records and STMPD really motivates me to continue. Hopefully this is just the beginning of a much longer list! 😉What anyone who starts making music these days will notice is how much competition there is. There are thousands of people who will be making the exact same music as you, so it’s really important to create a unique brand and finding a style which differs you from everyone else. In this digital age it’s easier than ever to make music which means there’s more competition than ever, but on the other hand it’s never been easier standing out and promoting yourself to millions of people at once. For a few bucks a day you can literally get promoted to hundreds if not thousands of people every day. That’s why I’d like to think the digital age brings more opportunities than challenges.When collaborating it’s important both artists share the same vision for the song and that there’s a possibility of mixing styles. For example, me and Elias (Santeli) both agreed on making something deep and powerful with few elements. He sent me an idea which I fell in love with, and after a few weeks of almost 15 versions it was finished. In the end I think you can clearly hear how both our styles are combined, and that is super important for any collaboration, to really bring out the best in both artists!Make sure to follow Robin Tayger across his channels:InstagramSpotifyYouTubeSoundCloudFacebook commentsYour email address will not be published.
