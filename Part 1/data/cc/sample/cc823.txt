We’re happy and proud to introduce SubmitHub events to our Feed. Here’s why this is awesome:In late 2015, Jason of Indie Shuffle created SubmitHub. A service that significantly eases up the lives of musicians, producers and their representatives. If you’re an artist trying to get a feature on an important blog or playlist, this endeavor can turn into quite an unnerving task. Especially if you’re not getting a response for a piece of art you worked your ass off for.Here’s where SubmitHub comes into play. For those of you who have never tried it, it’s basically a structured funnel between artists and blogs, channels (Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud), record labels and radio stations.It structures the submission process by regulating access via monetization. Consequently, SubmitHub premium credits give blog-owners a professional perspective and the opportunity to spend a miniature amount of time on each submission. The consequence for artists is a fast response-system, involving individual messages of approval or reasons of decline. As opposed to mass-mailed submission waves.And this might be the real selling point: Apart from getting the chance of a feature on a blog you dig, you, as a musician, are able to receive valuable, contextual pointers and feedback on your sound.Feedback by people who deal with music professionally on a daily basis is just invaluable. Furthermore, it can give you a sense of where you might be positioned within the streaming-sphere. It should definitely influence future conversations with your team, label, basically everyone creatively involved. And here’s the great news: We integrated SubmitHub into the ForTunes app. So from now on, you’re able to see the results of your SubmitHub campaigns rollin’ directly onto your mobile device.Each blog-post or playlist addition, generated through your SubmitHub campaign, will trigger a SubmitHub branded event on your ForTunes Feed: The most convenient way to monitor your blog outreach.The ForTunes App is available for free on the app store. commentsYour email address will not be published.
