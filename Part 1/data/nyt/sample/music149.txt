All five artists receive a $4,000 stipend, but because their work ranges widely, additional services vary for each honoree. They include access to rehearsal space, assistance with video production and consultations with industry experts.“Joe’s Pub Working Group was created to help make the business of being an artist in New York a little easier,” Alex Knowlton, the director of Joe’s Pub, said in an email. “We’re interested in the working life of an artist and have seen so many common needs among the huge spectrum of performers here.”“For the last 20 years, we’ve watched communities naturally occur amongst musicians, performers, designers, writers and more, and made it our mission to make space for all voices, collaborations and connections,” he added.
