It has become a treasured San Francisco staple, renowned as much for its spectacularly sculptural headgear as its content. (A San Francisco skyline hat is 14 feet high, nine feet wide and weighs more than 250 pounds.) It has been performed for a parade of notables, from Liza Minnelli to Queen Elizabeth II.“If ‘Seinfeld’ was about nothing, this is about everything,” Michael Janofsky wrote in The New York Times in 1998, “a wild musical homage to popular culture that has become no less a part of San Francisco than the Golden Gate Bridge, the Coit Tower and fog.”The show, which for years has been staged at Club Fugazi in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood, was created by Steve Silver, and is constantly updated. Mr. Silver died of AIDS in 1995; Ms. Silver is his widow.Follow Michael Paulson on Twitter: @MichaelPaulson.
