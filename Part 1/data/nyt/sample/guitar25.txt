And “Magic Mike” is on CMT.MARSHALL (2017) 8 p.m. on Showtime. “The only way to get through a bigot’s door,” Chadwick Boseman says in this Thurgood Marshall biopic, “is to break it down.” That captures the punchiness of this film, in which Boseman stars as the civil rights lawyer who became the first African-American to sit on the Supreme Court. With confidence and unexpected humor, it focuses on a 1941 case in which Marshall defended Joseph Spell, a black chauffeur and butler (played by Sterling K. Brown) accused of sexual assault by his rich, white boss (Kate Hudson). The case predates Brown v. Board of Education, in which Marshall made history, by more than a decade; the headstrong Marshall of this film is in his 30s. The movie, directed by Reginald Hudlin, revisits this era of Marshall’s life with “economy, a bit of gauzy nostalgia and likable performances,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. But, she said, there are moments when you wish that Hudlin “would ease up on the comedy.”MAGIC MIKE (2012) 9 p.m. on CMT. For a quiet, conventional Valentine’s Day evening skip this listing. But for a Feb. 14 full of onscreen thrusts, sweat and Channing Tatum’s, umm, face take advantage of this strategically timed showing of Steven Soderbergh’s stripper tale. Tatum plays Mike, who dips his toe into the world of erotic dancing and then falls the rest of the way in. (The character has parallels to Tatum himself, who once worked as a stripper.) Matthew McConaughey plays a strip club entrepreneur. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film a “funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream.”
