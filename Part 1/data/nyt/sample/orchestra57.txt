The head of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, Jerzy Owsiak, is a liberal critic of Law and Justice, the right-wing and populist party that in 2015 swept to power in Poland on the strength of the rural vote.Mr. Adamowicz, 53, has been mayor of Gdansk since 1998 and was re-elected as an independent in November elections that underscored a deep divide between Poland’s liberal cities and conservative countryside. He has advocated gay rights and tolerance for minorities, and expressed solidarity with the city’s Jewish community last year when a synagogue’s windows were broken.The A.P. quoted the police as saying the suspect in the knife attack was a 27-year-old with apparent mental problems who had previously carried out bank robberies, and that he had gained access to the area where Mr. Adamowicz was speaking with a media badge.Mr. Adamowicz was brought to the Medical University of Gdansk for surgery after the attack. The A.P. quoted Dr. Tomasz Stefaniak, a doctor at the hospital, as saying early on Monday morning that Mr. Adamowicz was alive but remained “in a very serious condition.”
