A woman knelt to drop off a bouquet. A teenager strummed his guitar and sang. Then, he wept.At 10:17 a.m., the time the local school district set to commemorate the 17 lives lost on Feb. 14, 2018, a man took off his purple cap.“Moment of silence,” he said.The crowd bowed its head.[Read how the Parkland massacre has changed the lives of the survivors in their own words.]Thursday could not possibly be a normal day in Parkland, Fla., where a still-grieving community coped by embracing the pain of it all.Stoneman Douglas scheduled a “day of service and love.” Teachers organized community service projects, but attendance was voluntary. School buses arrived in the morning nearly empty. After early dismissal, students with school IDs hanging around their necks — a requirement since the shooting — streamed by the flower garden. Most hugged. A few cried. Therapy dogs brought in to help students heal last year came back down from Philadelphia for the anniversary and frolicked around the teenagers’ legs.“After here, we’re going to the beach,” said Julia Brighton, a 16-year-old sophomore who was in the first classroom attacked last year. Two of her best friends, Alyssa Alhadeff and Gina Montalto, were killed. So was her neighbor, Alex Schachter. Julia said she could not see herself going to school on Thursday — only spending time with friends.“Whenever I’m alone, I get in my head. It’s like having a weight on you,” she said. “I surround myself with a lot of positive people.”In the evening, hundreds of people attended an interfaith vigil at nearby Pine Trails Park, an echo of the one a year ago, when the sound of gunfire was still fresh. Some people held single red roses or white carnations, which in any other context would have symbolized Valentine’s Day, a holiday that in this community may never be the same.“Valentine’s Day has forever changed for us,” said the Rev. Randy Cutter of the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, a town neighboring Parkland. “But it’s still about love — not romantic love, but the love that we have in our hearts for one another.”Tears were plentiful, but so were the warm greetings among friends and neighbors happy to at least be together. As the sun went down, a crowd, hushed except for the sound of sniffles, listened to the victims’ names recited from stage.[School safety. Gun control. Red flag laws.

This is “The Daily.” Today: It’s been one year since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “Daily” producer Clare Toeniskoetter went to Florida this week to check in on some of the students we met last year. It’s Thursday, February 14.clare toeniskoetterLast year, a few weeks after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, my colleague Jack Healy went down to Parkland and interviewed a group of freshman girls who were in the first classroom that the shooter went into, classroom 1216.studentI’ve thought about this, about being in a school shooting. And the one thing that I’ve always said that I would do is text my mom, “I love you,” and, like, “Thank you for everything.” And I was so mad at everything that I wasn’t going to be able to get to do that, and I was going to die and not let my mom know that I loved her.clare toeniskoetterAnd in that classroom, these girls saw eight of their classmates get shot.studentAnd then I just hear a few shots happen over here. And then I see Alyssa, and she’s just standing like this. And then she, like, falls back.clare toeniskoetterAnd three of them were killed. So Jack interviewed the girls, but I was the producer working on “The Daily” episode. And over the past year, I just haven’t stopped thinking about them. I’ve thought about them each time there’s been another mass shooting. I’ve thought about them on election night. And I thought about them just pretty much every time I’ve seen a group of teenagers. So as we approach the one-year anniversary of the shooting, I wanted to check back in with them.flight attendantPlease take a moment to locate the zone on your boarding pass.clare toeniskoetterSo I flew down to Florida, got the group back together at one of their houses. They grabbed a few snacks. And they all settled in on a couch.clare toeniskoetter (to the students)Tell me who you each are.jadeI’m Jade.clare toeniskoetterJade. And Jade, how old are you?jadeUh, 15.maddieI’m Maddie and I’m 15.clare toeniskoetterMaddie.brookeI’m Brooke and I’m 15.clare toeniskoetterBrooke.edenEden and I’m 15.clare toeniskoetterAnd Eden.clare toeniskoetter (to the students)And you’re about to turn 16?edenYep.clare toeniskoetterAnd they immediately just started talking about the last time they were all here together in the same room.edenI feel like it’s like after you see somebody in a movie, and it’s during something, and then you know when they have the 10 years later, and they cut their hair, and they — I feel like that now.jadeI mean, I did change my hair. [LAUGHTER]edenI feel like a different person than who I was when I was last sitting here.clare toeniskoetterWhat do you think you felt like then? What do you feel like now?edenI feel like now, I don’t know, in a way I feel burnt out a little, just like — I feel like I’ve been through hell. Like hell.maddieThis year has been exhausting.edenAnd at that moment, I feel like I was so innocent.clare toeniskoetterWhat were those first weeks back like? So it was about halfway through the school year. And what was a typical day like? Did it feel like normal school at all?brookeNo. Being together was the only good part about that.edenIt was weird. Because the setting was different. And then it was just that feeling in the room.jadeThat emptiness.edenIt’s like, oh my God, the kid who sat there died.clare toeniskoetterWas there ever a day when it felt normal, ever, like in your whole last school year?brookeIt kind of never feels normal. We have a new normal, I feel like. My normal is seeing the 1200 building every day and having flashbacks and then moving on.jadeOr like, oh, that happened.brookeExactly.edenAfter three months, I would say, is when it wasn’t all we thought about all the time. Like that wasn’t the feeling I had.jadeLike, summer was a good —maddieSummer was a good time.clare toeniskoetterYeah?maddieYeah, I’m not going to lie.jadeSummer was like, I was at my happiest.maddieWe were finally away from the building every day.clare toeniskoetterI wasn’t sure if summer would feel good or bad, being — because then you don’t have that built-in support group. But were you — did you stay with other Douglas students enough during your summers?brookeAll of our friends and stuff like that completely understand. At least for me, I talk about it with them all the time. And I for sure feel like I can trust them more than I can a therapist. Because they understand me and they know me. So it’s a lot more personal.clare toeniskoetterSo your friends who were also in school.jadeYeah, exactly.edenI don’t talk about it with anyone. Like, no one. I just can’t.clare toeniskoetterNot even friends?edenNot even my closest friend. It’s really hard for me to talk about it, because my closest friends, most of them weren’t in the building. And it’s just like, what is it going to help me to talk about it? They’re going to feel bad for me, and then what?clare toeniskoetterHow’s it feel right now?brookeI think it’s different when there’s someone in the building. Because all of my friends that weren’t, they feel like they can’t even talk to me about their day, because they don’t want to make me feel bad that they’re talking about it — which, like, that sucks, because I want my friends to be able to talk to me about it. Like, I have no problem with people who weren’t in the building talking. Just don’t act like where I was and where you were is the same thing. That’s my only thing.edenDon’t even try to compare it. It’s just like, it’s different.maddieIt’s different. It’s very, very different.brookeIt’s completely different.clare toeniskoetterShifting into the new school year, how did it feel coming back?maddieI hated it.edenIt was awful.clare toeniskoetterYeah?jadeIt was just like, oh, like, oh.brookeWe’re back here?clare toeniskoetterSo one of the things, from my understanding about going back to school last year, is everyone who was at the school was there on the day of the shooting. But then when you came back to school this year, for this new school year, there’s now a new class. There are freshmen who weren’t there. What is that like?maddieNot good.clare toeniskoetterWhy?brookeThe thing is, some of them are actually very nice and very understanding and accept the fact that they don’t know anything about it and they’re not going to ask, because they know it’s disrespectful. And then the other half are just —maddieWish that they were there.brookeJust wish they were there and are trying so hard to get attention from it, in any way possible.maddieThey post pictures of the building. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Like, you’ve never even —edenHave photoshoots.brookeAnd they think it’s funny.maddieYou’ve never even been in the building. How are you going to post a picture of it?jadeUnless their sibling was at open house, I don’t know.brookeBut they think it’s funny. And they’re dropping textbooks, popping things.maddieOh, my god.brookeLike, someone that has serious PTSD could be right next to you.clare toeniskoetterWait, so they are walking through the halls and making loud noises, dropping textbooks. [INTERPOSING VOICES]brookeThey do it in their classes all the time, for fun.jadeI was taking a math test — it’s a thing.clare toeniskoetterThat’s so cruel.maddieOne of them, after the pep rally, I was walking back to class to portables, and we were right in front of the freshman building. And one of them popped a water bottle right in back of me. Right in front of the freshman building.clare toeniskoetterSo it’s more than just one nasty kid. It’s a lot of them.maddieThey just don’t have — they’re not considerate. They don’t know what they’re doing.brookeThey don’t give empathy to the situation.maddieThey don’t think about it.brookeExactly. And it might be because they don’t really understand. But if you don’t understand, then just don’t do anything. Don’t try to be funny, because it’s not funny.clare toeniskoetterYeah. It’s so — hearing you as sophomores talk about the freshmen, like, there’s this dynamic in any high school experience of feeling like, now I’m older and I hate those freshmen. But of course, it’s completely different for you.brooke— this whole separation, this whole divide.edenThere’s a line.maddieI have no issue with them on any other problem, except for the shooting.brookeAnything else, I don’t even really care.clare toeniskoetterYeah. What do you think is the ideal? What, if you were a freshman this year, what do you think would be the best way?edenJust don’t talk about it.studentJust be respectful.brookeDon’t act like you know anything about it. Because you don’t. [INTERPOSING VOICES]edenDon’t bring it up. Ever.maddieDon’t talk about it like you know what we went through.brookeThey don’t know anything.maddieBecause I know that you were scared and you didn’t know what was going on.clare toeniskoetterBecause a lot of them were next door in the middle school and got evacuated. But they weren’t —edenIt was different.jadeIt was really scary for them. But for us, it’s terrifying.brookeIt’s just different.clare toeniskoetterYeah.brookeI heard it right in my ear, in the hallways. So don’t act like it’s the same.clare toeniskoetterDoes all of this, does it make you feel older?edenI feel like I’m, like, a 90-year-old woman.brookeI feel like we didn’t really — we kind of fast-tracked. [INTERPOSING VOICES]maddieYeah, telling stories about her life.jadeAnd I feel really bad for —brookeI feel bad celebrating my birthday sometimes.edenI feel bad getting my license. I feel bad —brookeWhen they can’t —clare toeniskoetterMilestones. Every milestone feels —edenIt’s really hard.brookeI just feel so guilty.jadeJust getting up every day. Sometimes.brookeLike, they’re supposed to be here. Like, that whole thing wasn’t supposed to happen.maddieYou gotta talk about it.brookeI kinda feel like our childhood got ruined.jadeIt did, yeah.brookeI feel like it’s not there anymore.maddieLike, our high school, everybody says high school is the best time of your life, along with college. But we don’t get that.edenBut it’s not because it’s consuming our lives.maddieYeah. It’s never going to be like that anymore. It’s never going to be like, oh, it’s high school.brookeLike, no cares in the world.edenWhen your parents are like, oh, when I was in high school, this. It’s like, when I was in high school, all I can think about would be the shooting.jadeYeah.edenIt’s hard to differentiate what’s from the shooting and what’s from regular teenage anxiety. Because everybody has anxiety. Everybody. So for me, it’s like, I’ll get those times where I’ll feel like there’s literally — I’m just like, I can’t, I can’t. And I don’t know if it’s from the shooting, and I don’t know what it’s from.brookeIt’s a combination of things, not just [INAUDIBLE] the shooting.edenThat sets the basis for it.maddieSometimes the stress of the shooting has a big impact on regular teenage stresses. So it’ll make your normal teenage stresses more stressful.edenEven more dramatic.clare toeniskoetterBecause you guys are all 15, about to turn 16. So what’s going on in your lives outside of this? You’re about to get driver’s licenses.jadeYeah, exactly.maddieSchool.clare toeniskoetterDating.maddieI mean, right now in life we’re worried about next year. Next year’s going to be our junior year, which is, like, the most important year.clare toeniskoetterCollege.jadeDefinitely, I’m thinking about that the most.maddieStarting to think about colleges, which is scary, but —edenSo scary.maddieSo scary.brookeAnd I’m really scared to apply to colleges, because I don’t want to be accepted just because I’m a Douglas kid. Like, I don’t want that to be the reason why —edenI don’t want that to be my —brookeI get above someone else.eden— the definition of who I am.brookeExactly. I don’t want to look good to your college just because I was in the shooting.edenI just feel like time’s going by so fast.jadeIt really is. I can’t believe it’s almost been a year.edenIt’s crazy.jadeAnd that’s what I’m scared of.brookeI feel like it was, like, yesterday.edenThat, to me, is crazy.jadeLike, I relive it every day, for me at least.maddieI think because we’ve just been living in it this whole year, it just hasn’t gone away. It’s not something that —jadeLike, it surrounds. When I look back on the person I was exactly a year ago from today, she would have not acted like this at all. She would have been a completely different person.clare toeniskoetterYou think you were fundamentally changed?jadeYeah, definitely.brookeYeah. I think everyone is. I don’t think anyone can mentally be the same after what we went through.edenIt’s a part of you.brookeExactly.jadeSometimes I’ll think about when I’m 20, I’ll think about, like, oh, that happened — what would that be? Seven years ago. Like, that’s scary.maddieYeah. I think about when —jadeIt’s been that long.maddie— we have kids, how are we going to send our kids to school?brookeIt’s so hard for me to want to have kids in a place like this.maddieHow are we going to have kids and send them to school like that?brookeI’ve wanted kids my whole life. But I don’t know if I want them anymore.edenIf my kid will have to go through what I went through, I’d just feel so bad.brookeIt makes me not want to have kids. And I’ve wanted kids my whole life.maddieObviously, in the very, very, very far future.brookeNo, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.maddieWe’re talking about kids in the way future.edenActually, six more months. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC]maddieI always say this. I always say this. Everybody who goes through mass shootings don’t go to the site of the mass shooting every single day and see the building where it happened every single day. We do.brookeA part of me kind of wants to go in.maddieI want to go in so bad.edenI want to go in so bad. I still do.maddieI think we all agreed in 1216 —brookeIt would give us nice closure.maddie— that we want to go in. [INTERPOSING VOICES]edenLast year, we were saying we all — I still want to go in.jadeAt the same time, I don’t want to see that.brookeLike, I want to —maddieI just want to see how they left it.jadeYeah, that’s what I want to see. I want to grab my English binder. [LAUGHTER]edenThere’s just something so curious about how we went there every single day. I was in that building every single day.brookeI had, like, four classes in there.jadeI had two.edenIt’s so weird to me.clare toeniskoetterWhat do you think you would do if you could go in?jadeOh, I’d go in, just walk.maddieI would just walk. [INTERPOSING VOICES]clare toeniskoetterTogether?jadeThe first thing I’d do is go in our classroom.maddieI’ve had dreams about —edenMe, too.jadeI don’t want to see the blood stains.brookeI have it kind of engraved of a thought with just, like, Valentine’s stuff everywhere.maddieOr backpacks. Well, I guess we’re going to see it. We’re going to see it when the trial happens.clare toeniskoetterYou’ll be able to go in?maddieNo, we’re not going to be able to go in. But we’ll see pictures.clare toeniskoetterYou’ll see photos.brookeI still want to see it for myself.maddieI know. [INTERPOSING VOICES]brookeHas anyone had time travel dreams or anything like that?maddieWe sound like literal psychopaths right now. We sound like psychopaths.jadeWe sound insane.clare toeniskoetterTime travel dream?brookeBecause I — it’s a recurring nightmare dream I have. I don’t really have anything about going forward. But I always have this dream where I’m able to go back to that date, and I try to warn people. And I try to warn Alaina, because she was my closest friend in that class. And she won’t listen to me. No one will listen to me.edenI had that, too. And I remember I had a dream, and I showed Alyssa my tattoo, because I have a tattoo.clare toeniskoetterWhat’s your tattoo of?edenIt has the room number on it.clare toeniskoetterDo you all have them?brookeNo.edenAnd I remember I was, in my dream, I was showing her. I was showing her in my dream. And she was, like —maddieThree hearts for them?edenNot believing me. And I was like, look, I’m telling you, there was a shooting. Don’t go to class. And she went anyways.jadeI would have just, like, kidnapped her at the front, like, you’re coming with me.edenI didn’t know you got a tattoo.clare toeniskoetterCan you tell me what they both are?maddieYeah. So mine is, the top is the date in Roman numerals, 2-14-18. The second layer is the three hearts for Alex, Alyssa and Alaina. And the third layer is 1216, which is our classroom number.clare toeniskoetterAnd what’s yours?edenAnd then mine is, like, a flower, which is kind of, if you see, there’s leaves on it. And that represents the growth from what happened. And then there’s the room number, 1216, and then there’s three little flower petals things, for Alaina, Alex and Alyssa.maddieMakes me feel close to them. I love that.edenI like it. But some days, I’m like, I wish I didn’t have to get this tattoo. Like, I hate how it’s part of, it’s permanent. And so is the shooting. It’s permanent on you. [INTERPOSING VOICES]brookeThe thing is, I’m always going to think of it, and I want that there.maddieYeah, I think the significance of getting something permanent on you is that just like the tattoo, the shooting is going to be with you for the rest of your life.brookeFor the rest of your life. [MUSIC]edenFor, like, three months after the shooting, I would always be searching up videos of the shooting and watching them over and over.brookeSame, same, same.clare toeniskoetterWhy? [INTERPOSING VOICES]edenBecause I needed, I needed that closure. I needed to actually see that was real.brookeI think that’s why a lot of us want to go in the room. We just want closure. Because I have no closure on anything.edenAll we have is our memory. And that’s not as reliable, to me, as a picture. [INTERPOSING VOICES]brookeAnd that’s going to fade.clare toeniskoetterDo you think you’ll ever have closure?edenNo.brookeProbably not.edenMaybe.clare toeniskoetterHow could you have?maddieHopefully.edenThe building. The videos.brookeLike, I want to have closure. But I don’t know if it’s attainable.edenI think after the actual videos of it happening, I would love to see that.jadeI started —clare toeniskoetterAnd that exists, in some —edenI think it will.brookeThey exist.edenThey have videos.jadeI’ve seen a picture.maddieThe hallway.jadeBut that’s it.maddieWell, I watch everything that comes out. Everything that comes out, I watch. Every article that comes out about it, I watch. Because I like to know everything that happened. Even though I know, I just don’t — I’d just like to —edenThey don’t have the proof of it.maddieBecause then I don’t look like an idiot telling my story, like, oh, yeah.clare toeniskoetterIt’s validating.maddieYeah. [MUSIC]clare toeniskoetterWhat are you planning on doing this Thursday?maddieCemeteries. More cemeteries. Vigils. I’m going to two cemeteries.jadeAre you going to Alyssa’s?maddieI’m going to — is Alex buried there?edenYeah, they’re right next to — they’re right, literally so close to each other. I went to Alyssa’s, and I saw Max there. And I went to go see, and it was literally right next to it.maddieIs his headstone up?edenYeah.brookeI want to visit Alaina’s, but —maddieI haven’t seen since his.jadeWait, where’s Alaina’s?brookeI don’t know where Alaina’s is.maddieI’m going to Martin’s and I’m going to Luke’s, which are both in the same — [SIGH]clare toeniskoetterAnd you don’t have school on Thursday. Friday is optional?maddieOptional.jadeI mean, both of them is optional.maddieYeah.brookeThey’re both going to be there, but like —clare toeniskoetterYou’re able to go and do service projects. Is that right? Are any of you going to go into school on Thursday?maddieNo. I can’t. I couldn’t even stay for the rest of today.edenYeah, today was hard.maddieI had to leave after third.edenI left early and came late.jadeAre you going tomorrow?maddieNo. I can’t. I physically, like, starting on Monday, I walked into school and I couldn’t.jadeI feel like if I don’t, like, I don’t want to be at home thinking about it.edenYeah. I don’t want to be home by myself.jadeOh, yeah, I know.edenI don’t like that.maddieI’d rather be home than there.brookeThe thing is, I’ve already — I have so much makeup work.jadeI feel like I have to go to school. It’s so bad.brookeI have so much makeup work because I’ve gone early for so many days, because of everything just being too much. And I feel like I can’t miss any more school because the amount of things I have to make up is insane.maddieTomorrow is not going to be an academic day at all.brookeIt is.jadeYeah. I’m learning a lesson in math.brookeI have things planned in bio.jadeAnd I have homework over the weekend. And a test next week in there.brookeSame. [MUSIC]clare toeniskoetterWhat do you think that people get wrong about you? What do you think people should understand about you who were in the classroom?maddieSomething that I’ve always wished that the media knew is that — what we went through, other than the politics. Not everything’s about March for Our Lives. And whereas March for Our Lives is great, and the fact that they can make a change is amazing. But we have stories that are worth being told. And I think that —edenAnd are worth hearing.maddieAnd I think that the media is just so quick to politicize everything, because that’s what makes everything a story. But not everything’s political, and we’re actually going through something that’s real. And really bad.edenAnd it’s happening.maddieYeah, and it happened to us.brookeAnd it happened when we were, like, 14 or 15.edenThat’s what’s so amazing about what the March for Our Lives kids did. But now over time, it’s obviously getting less of a national discussion, less important in our conversations right now.jadeLess vital.edenWhich is upsetting.brookeI feel like another thing, too, is — especially with a bunch of news stations and stuff like that — because I feel like a lot of people forget. And I wish people knew that just because the cameras went away and people aren’t writing about it as much does not mean that the issue went away. Like, people are still depressed. People are still having panic attacks and anxiety attacks. And there are still people that can’t go throughout the day without breaking down because of this. And they didn’t just like, poof, when the camera stopped reporting them or their interview ended — nothing stopped.clare toeniskoetterWhat do you hope comes out of someone knowing that, of fully understanding your story of being in the room?maddieFor me, it’s more about memorializing them and remembering them. Because that’s what matters. To me, that’s what matters, is to keep —edenTo make sure their names aren’t forgotten.jadeTo keep them alive.maddieBecause they didn’t deserve to die. And they’re not here to share their stories.brookeBut we can do that for them. And I think that’s the only reason that —jadeIn a non-political way.brooke— exactly — is that we just want their name to be there forever. They didn’t go away. They’re going to be there with us in our memories as long as we live. And we, as the people who survived it, can bring their memory to life to other people and to show them how amazing they were. They didn’t meet them. But we hope that by telling you how smart Alaina was, by telling you how kind Alex was, by telling you how funny Alyssa was, that you can understand.clare toeniskoetterI think you guys have done a wonderful job honoring them.studentsThank you. Thank you all for talking to me. [MUSIC]maddieI want to take a picture of all of us. Like, a mirror selfie.edenOoh, right now?clare toeniskoetterI can take one of you guys, if you want.maddieNo, it’s O.K. It’s better like a mirror.edenFor Snapchat.jadeOr Instagram.brookeO.K., so there’s two options here with mirrors. [INTERPOSING VOICES]Many of the victims’ families made a joint public appearance on Wednesday after meeting with Gov. Ron DeSantis. Some of the families have pushed for the state to hold more local officials accountable for what happened.“They’ve had a year to fix Broward County and make our schools safer,” said Max Schachter, Alex’s father. “This is ground zero, and they continue to fail us.”But Mr. DeSantis, who suspended former Sheriff Scott Israel last month over his handling of the shooting, told them he will not remove Superintendent Robert W. Runcie of the Broward County Public Schools because Mr. Runcie is appointed by elected school board members — several of whom were re-elected last fall. Instead, Mr. DeSantis asked the Florida Supreme Court to impanel a grand jury to investigate security across the state’s public school districts, with a focus on Broward.President Trump pledged on Wednesday to keep schools safe. “Our entire nation mourns for the victims and their loved ones,” he told a sheriffs’ association.Outside Stoneman Douglas on Thursday, news crews lined up to broadcast from the scene. Survivors suffering from the lingering effects of trauma had asked that media helicopters, whose rotors trigger reminders of the day of the shooting, stay away, and they did.“I haven’t been able to drive down this street for a year,” said Gibson Sylvestre, a Parkland resident whose sister graduated from Stoneman Douglas in the late 1990s. “Today I said, ‘You know what? If all these kids can come here, then I can come here.’ It’s been devastating.”“It’s a very emotional day,” said Mirella Ortiz, 39, who brought her three young children to the memorial garden to pay their respects. The family moved to Parkland for its excellent public schools — especially Stoneman Douglas — and Ms. Ortiz’s younger sister was a senior on the day of the shooting. “She wanted to be home today,” she said. “And we chose to be here.”Some students gathered for private moments of remembrance. Ronit Reoven, an advanced placement psychology teacher who lost one student, Carmen Schentrup, and had three others injured, had to pick up platters for a picnic that her students from that day organized at a nearby park. The group has gathered periodically over the past year, over doughnuts, sushi and Mexican food, she said.“Someone can say, ‘I had a bad dream,’ and they all get each other,” Ms. Reoven said.Her departure to the picnic kept getting delayed by reporters asking about the memorial garden she planted with one of her students, Tori Gonzalez, and by students and parents wrapping her in bear hugs. “I just can’t believe it’s been a year, because it still feels fresh,” she said.Jon Faber, 50, reminded others in the community that Ms. Reoven, 47, saved the life of his son’s best friend: She tied a tourniquet on Ben Wikander’s arm using a baby blanket she used in her classroom to cover a Keurig coffee machine.“It’s not normal, for 17 people to die in school,” Mr. Faber said.Another one of his son’s friends, Sammy Feuerman, 18, who graduated from Stoneman Douglas last year, drove down from Florida State University in Tallahassee to be in Parkland for the anniversary. “I just felt I needed to be here,” he said.Sometimes he wears Stoneman Douglas T-shirts in college and “people nod their heads in respect,” Mr. Feuerman said. “I used to say I’m from Fort Lauderdale, I’m from Boca, because no one knew Parkland. Now I say Parkland.”The anniversary made Mr. Feuerman reminisce about the day before the shooting, which was the last time he played basketball with Joaquin Oliver before he was killed. Days after that, Mr. Feuerman had made his way to the State Capitol to implore lawmakers to tighten Florida’s gun laws. Now, he’s studying criminology, a decision he made after the shooting.“I definitely want to do something where I can prevent bad things from happening,” he said. “People should know that Douglas and Parkland are not going away anytime soon.”Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article attributed an erroneous distinction to the Parkland, Fla., shooting last year. It was one of the nation’s deadliest school shootings, not the deadliest.
