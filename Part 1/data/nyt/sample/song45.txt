It features disco, Western choral music and Native American field recordings from the Dust Bowl era.Nonmusical recordings are admitted to the registry as well. Among this year’s lot are Robert F. Kennedy’s speech on April 4, 1968, the date of Martin Luther King Jr.’s murder, and the monologues of Ruth Draper, a famed actress in the early to mid-20th century.Each year’s selections are officially made by the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, though the National Recording Preservation Board supplies her with expert recommendations. Recordings must be at least 10 years old to qualify; they are chosen for being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,” according to the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000.The new inductees bring the total number of recordings in the archive to 525.
