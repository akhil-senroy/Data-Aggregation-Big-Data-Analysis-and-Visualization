On this week’s podcast, Mizrahi talks about his upbringing in a conservative Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn, how he chose a career path and why he can’t kick the singing habit.“It was something that I could not stop doing,” he says of his cabaret shows. “I’m not exactly sure how you stop something like that because it’s so darn fun. It’s probably the most expressive thing for me possible; to get on a stage and just tell stories and sing. So, you try and repress that. Darling, you simply cannot.”David McCraw also visits this week. He didn’t have far to travel; he works in the building, as The Times’s deputy general counsel, and he talks about his new book, “Truth in Our Times: Inside the Fight for Press Freedom in the Age of Alternative Facts.” “It’s almost understandable that someone who is getting tough press would want to push back,” McCraw says. “That’s Donald Trump. What’s disconcerting is how many people go along with that idea that somehow the press is the enemy. I think it’s really deadly for democracy.”Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai talk about the books they’ve recently reviewed.
