Once that was done, the minimally witty movie implied that she’d live in a less dodgy fashion than that which got her killed, over and over again, in the first place.The cosmic conditions that created this fix were not explained in that picture. But, boy, are they ever in the sequel “Happy Death Day 2U,” written and directed by Christopher Landon, who directed the original film and penned several films from the “Paranormal Activity” franchise. Turns out a student experiment in the quantum physics lab is responsible for shifting realities, and Tree soon finds herself catapulted back to her death day. Under different conditions this time, one of them happy: In this dimension, her beloved mom is still alive.But she is still going to die every day. While the first film worked a relatively simple “solve the mystery and save your life” challenge, here Tree uses her predicament as a grand self-help course, not unlike Bill Murray’s character in “Groundhog Day” and his piano lessons.Jessica Rothe as Tree is still an appealing presence. But the film is overstuffed with unfunny self-parodying gore slapstick, half-felt sentimentality and semi-meta sci-fi — characters mention “Inception” and “Back to the Future,” just to let you know that they know that we know. It ends as neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. This, despite the preponderance of herrings thrown about during its running time.Movie data powered by IMDb.comRated PG-13 for standard horror scares and gore slapstick. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes.
