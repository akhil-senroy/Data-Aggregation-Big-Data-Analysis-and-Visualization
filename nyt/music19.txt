[Read about the final run of the Met’s “Aida.”]There will be just two more performances, on March 4 and 7. When the opera returns, it’ll be to open the 2020-21 season in a new staging by Michael Mayer, of the Met’s Rat Pack “Rigoletto.” (The “Aida” cast looks incredible: Anna Netrebko, Anita Rachvelishvili, Piotr Beczala and Ludovic Tézier, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin.)Other things this week:— Josh Barone revisited John Adams’s recent opera “Girls of the Golden West” in Amsterdam.— Accusations of bullying threaten Daniel Barenboim’s previously sacrosanct position in the Berlin music scene.— Nate Wooley makes amazing music.— Hear seven of the best works from the middle of the last century, a sadly neglected period in American music.— Reviews of “Falstaff” at the Met, a virtuosic pianist and the tenor Matthew Polenzani. (Gotta love a singer who programs Janacek’s “Diary of One Who Disappeared.”)In a tweet, the composer Nico Muhly yanked me in the direction of Alexandre Tharaud’s recording of Rameau keyboard works, which I listened to and promptly recommended to everyone I know. You need to hear this strange and glorious recording!Enjoy the weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE
