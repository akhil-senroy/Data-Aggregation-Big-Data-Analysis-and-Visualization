And Reinaldo Marcus Green’s “Monsters and Men” is streaming on Hulu.WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS 10 p.m. on FX. Are Staten Island vampires any different than New Zealand vampires? Fans of the 2015 mockumentary “What We Do in the Shadows” are about to find out. The funny Kiwis Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Conchords) and Taika Waititi (the director of “Thor: Ragnarok”) have taken that movie, which they directed, and turned it into a TV series of the same name. The series trades the Wellington vampire roommates of the film for a group of ancient bloodsuckers struggling to adjust to life on Staten Island. But its laughs tend to come from the same source as the film’s: mainly, the vampires’ tendency toward human folly. “Humans are so [expletive] stupid and boring and lazy that given the gift of immortality, you’d never get around to doing anything,” Waititi recently told The New York Times. “You’d just put off everything. People that have been alive for 5,000 years, going: ‘I’ve got forever to learn how to play violin. Why start now?’”MONSTERS AND MEN (2018) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. John David Washington may have been most visible in 2018 as a Ku Klux Klan-infiltrating police officer in Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” but that wasn’t his only leading role last year. In this debut feature from the writer and director Reinaldo Marcus Green, Washington plays Dennis, an African-American officer in New York who struggles with knowledge of his squad’s racism. He makes up about a third of the narrative here, alongside the “Hamilton” actor Anthony Ramos as a Brooklyn father who witnesses a police shooting and Kelvin Harrison Jr., who plays a teenage baseball star turned activist. As their stories play off one another and the political heat rises, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, “the movie stays cool, its smooth, smart climax in keeping with its levelheaded tone.”
