And “Chef’s Table” returns on Netflix.AMERICAN MASTERS — CHARLEY PRIDE: I’M JUST ME 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). “When Jackie Robinson went to the major leagues, I was picking cotton beside my dad,” the singer Charley Pride recalls near the beginning of this documentary. “And I said to myself, ‘Here’s my way out of the cotton field.’” While Pride didn’t end up becoming a baseball star, he did break his own ground as a trailblazing country music star — and as one of the relatively few black performers to reach his level of success in the genre. This hourlong documentary charts Pride’s rise, beginning with his childhood in Sledge, Miss., where he was born in 1938 to a family of sharecroppers. Dolly Parton, Brad Paisley, Whoopi Goldberg, Marty Stuart, Willie Nelson and others make appearances.TONE BELL: CAN’T CANCEL THIS 10 p.m. on Showtime. The comedian Tone Bell, known as the fiancé in the CBS sitcom “Fam” and a war-veteran-turned-security-guard in Netflix’s “Disjointed,” discusses student loans (paid) and Alaska (cold) in this comedy special.INTERSTELLAR (2014) 10:25 p.m. on FXM. Environmental catastrophe is at the center of Christopher Nolan’s anxious and ambitious space movie, which stars Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway as astronauts on a mission to find humans a new home planet. That the search is necessary is a product of a Dust Bowl-like blight that has rendered Earth unable to produce most crops (other than corn). In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film “distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth.”
