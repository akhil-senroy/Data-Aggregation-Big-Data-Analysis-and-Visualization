This has been our favorite tweet of the day.Spoiler Alert: "The Place Where Lost Things Go" from "Mary Poppins Returns" will be performed on the #Oscars.  BONUS SPOILER ALERT: It will be performed by a surprise special guest!“I’ll Fight,” written by 10-time nominee Diane Warren and performed by Jennifer Hudson for the documentary “RBG,” will now reportedly appear on the broadcast alongside performances of the Lady Gaga single “Shallow” from “A Star Is Born” and the Kendrick Lamar hit “All the Stars” from “Black Panther.”Though Emily Blunt performs the nominated song “The Place Where Lost Things Go” in “Mary Poppins Returns,” the promise of a “surprise special guest” may indicate that someone may take Blunt’s place at the Oscars.There is no word yet whether the Oscars will find room for the remaining song, “When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings” from “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.” Still, it’s encouraging that for once, the academy is adding rather than subtracting from the broadcast.It’s been reported that in pursuit of a three-hour running time, the Oscars for several tech categories will be given out during the commercial breaks and edited together into a package shown later on the show, another decision that has drawn fire. Only one thing is clear: With the hostless Oscar telecast fast approaching on Feb. 24, the ultimate layout of the show may provide as many surprises as the winners themselves.
