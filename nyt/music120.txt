AdvertisementLast year (and plenty of years before that), the Grammys were deeply unfortunate. The show paid mere lip service to the successes of women and nonwhite performers, and were boring to boot. So the bar for this year’s ceremony, which took place Sunday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was low, and the remit was clear: do everything the opposite of how it has been done.To some degree, the 61st annual Grammy Awards delivered. Though there were ample tributes to the music of decades past, and some awkwardly cut-short speeches (see: Drake, Dua Lipa), there were also performances from worthy young singers (Camila Cabello, H.E.R.), rising hip-hop stars (Cardi B, Travis Scott) and the next generation of Americana royalty (Kacey Musgraves, Brandi Carlile). That most of the show’s most impressive moments came from women was a rebuke to all the recent years in which the Grammys seemed content to sideline impressive female talent.Reliving the highs and lows of this year’s Grammys on this week’s Popcast:Joe Coscarelli, The New York Times’s pop music reporter
