As Al Hart, a retired agent for stand-up comics who takes his very first client (Richard Dreyfuss) on the road for one last tour, Chase mostly engages in his trademark mugging, while his earnest moments are smothered by the clumsiness of the filmmaking.Photographed, edited and directed with the minimal competency of an 1980s TV movie, with every scene slathered in a pushy, secondhand musical score (lest we’re ever left to decide how to feel about any of its events for ourselves), “The Last Laugh” is also hobbled by the weakness that has plagued stand-up narratives from “Punchline” to “The Comedian”: all the onstage material, whether intended to be bad or brilliant, simply isn’t funny.The picture’s single saving grace is Chase’s co-star Dreyfuss, who deploys all of his considerable charisma. He shines, but not brightly enough to bring this moribund project to life.Movie data powered by IMDb.comThe Last LaughNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.
