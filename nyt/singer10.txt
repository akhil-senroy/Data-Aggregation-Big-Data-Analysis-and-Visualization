Davide Traxler, the house’s chief executive, said he wanted “a talking piece for ladies” and also to show that Parmigiani’s stone-setting know-how was equal to its mechanical watchmaking.As for the choice of rainbow, Mr. Traxler admitted he was influenced by a former employer.“After 14 years working for Chopard, you kind of get into ladies’ watches and rainbows,” he said.Audemars Piguet, too, has linked its watchmaking with fashion cred, unveiling two rainbow-set bezels on its Royal Oak model.The first has a bezel of 32 multicolored, baguette-cut sapphires that is set on a bracelet and case of frosted white gold — the sparkling, hammered finish that the jeweler Carolina Bucci created for the watchmaker in 2016. An openwork dial showcases two balance wheels and two hairsprings sharing the same axis.Additionally, a pink gold, 37-millimeter Offshore Chronograph features a rainbow bezel of baguette-cut sapphires, set on a rubber strap.Rainbow razzmatazz works especially well on social media, but it isn’t the only colorway commanding attention.Ricardo Guadalupe, the chief executive of Hublot, said he looked beyond the watch world to create interesting pieces.After all, he said, “You can read the time everywhere now — we have to go beyond that.”So the house has collaborated with the singer Nicky Jam to celebrate reggaeton, the Latin-Caribbean hip-hop music scene, with a line of skeletonized, gold-plated watches.The 45-millimeter Hublot Big Bang Meca-10 Nicky Jam King Gold features a bezel of 48 baguette-cut gems — 16 orange sapphires, 16 yellow sapphires and 16 tsavorites — which are the same colors seen in the singer’s music video “X (Equis).”“Everybody can use diamonds,” Mr. Guadalupe said. “But when you use a different approach — working with the aesthetic of the gems — it’s interesting.”For its debut women’s watch collection, the avant-garde house RJ (once known as Romain Jerome) wasn’t satisfied with colored gem-set bezels alone. Its new Arraw Star Twist also features a mechanism that spins the bezel — and, when coupled with the kind of sapphire, topaz and amethyst mix on one model — the effect is striking.“Bejeweled bezels are more than a trend, they define a character,” said the company’s chief executive, Marco Tedeschi. “The collection is designed for trend-conscious women who are on the move and who express their creativity with personality and flair.”For more traditional houses, exceptional gem-setting makes the statement.Last month, Dior introduced a chunky, new square bezel to its round-dial couture gown-inspired Grand Bal collection, essentially creating a larger canvas to show off its diamond-cutting savoir-faire with 64 baguette-cut diamonds combined with 127 round-cut ones.Jaeger-LeCoultre and Piaget also introduced new gem-setting techniques and larger carat sizes.Jaeger-LeCoultre’s latest Rendez-Vous pieces employ a new griffe, or prong, setting, which effectively lets more light into each stone to enhance its brilliance. The watchmaker also added a secondary ring of smaller diamonds in a grain setting, bringing the total count to 168 diamonds weighing 3.43 carats (the previous model had 60, totaling 0.63 carats.)Piaget took a similar approach with its new Limelight Gala watches, featuring an asymmetrical diamond bezel at 4.74 carats hugging the sides of a watch face.Over all, it’s just like that moment in “The Wizard of Oz” when black and white becomes brilliant. But it’s on your wrist.
