In a very different kind of reality-show competition, the sixth season of “Forged in Fire” brings together bladesmiths who show off their weapon-making skills for the chance to win $10,000. The show is hosted by Wil Willis, a former Army Ranger; J. Neilson, a veteran knife maker; Doug Marcaida, the hand-to-hand-combat specialist; and David Baker, a swordsmith well versed in ancient weaponry. As its name suggests, the series features a lot of fire, so it’s best not to try to replicate the action at home: In 2017, one aspiring bladesmith caused a massive blaze.
