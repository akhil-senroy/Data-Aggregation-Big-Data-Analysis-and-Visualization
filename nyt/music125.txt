It’ll work out.”[Watch how Kacey Musgraves turned country music psychedelic.]And women ruled the MGM Grand Garden Arena stage as Chrissy Metz, of hit NBC show “This Is Us,” made her live TV performance debut, alongside the country stars Lauren Alaina, Mickey Guyton and Maddie & Tae, for a stirring rendition of “I’m Standing With You.”Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line opened the show with a rousing performance of “Can’t Hide Red,” but some on social media took offense to Tyler Hubbard’s American flag suit.Dan + Shay scored three straight early wins, for song of the year and single of the year for “Tequila,” as well as duo of the year.Male artist of the year went to Thomas Rhett.The star-laden three-hour show marked an upbeat return to celebrating country music after last year’s awards assumed a somber note following the October 2017 mass shooting, also in Las Vegas, that killed 58 people at a country music festival.Aldean, who was performing at that festival when the gunfire broke out, received the ACM artist of the decade award.Other country stars performing included Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan, Chris Stapleton, Urban, Brooks & Dunn, Miranda Lambert, McEntire and George Strait.
