Thanks to Lightroom CC, I can shoot beautiful raw photos (in HDR), easily organize them, easily fix/improve them, and automatically upload them to the cloud where they don’t eat up space on my phone.   I must say that I feel like about 95% of the time I can tweak photos to look exactly what I am hoping for.  A major reason for this is the ability to highlight just a region of the photo and adjust the brightness/color to that region.  And it is really nice how how the app also ties fairly seamlessly with other Adobe apps such as the two Photoshop apps.  I could go on and on about other features I like and other minor things that just are smart and show Adobe was paying attention to detail.  My complaints are few and far between, and I’m sure will get tweaked in future version. For these reasons, I am generally confident 90% of the time just walking around with my iPhone to take pictures rather than my bulky Canon 5D Mark IV.  My friends keep asking me what app I am using for taking and editing the pictures.  I keep telling them they should get this app.Load up your photos on your desktop or laptop from a REAL camera or phone. Create a collection in Lightroom, transfer to Photoshop and back to Lightroom.  Share  entire album within seconds to your contacts. Pretty smooth. Absolutely NOTHING comes close to what PSCC & Lightroom can do. Absolutely love this system.             I generally shoot with dslrs and use several features in photoshop that Lightroom can’t duplicate or run. I only have the “save as smart previews only” because the don’t take up much room on the server and I can send the “collections link” to anyone I wish to share. There is a slider to allow the sender to download the smart preview. Most of the senders are family and only view on their phones or tablets. I keep originals(RAW) on portable drives and connects with saved presets from PSCC/Lightroom.            This is still my best program for travel and family photos. I still can’t get away from focal lengths, aperatures available and picture quality of a real camera. I print and display my work at the office and my home . There is a difference between cell phone and larger sensor size. Physics still dominates , no way around that yet but, maybe in my lifetime ?
