We at ForTunes are all about connecting your digital sphere with your physical music environment. To give you some ideas how you can connect these two spheres, let us drop some pointers on getting the most out of your festival season – even on a streaming level!Let’s start with some personally cooked playlists:A great way of connecting your streaming persona with festival activity is creating a playlist – including fellow acts that you share stages with.You can tag these artists when sharing the playlist, and try to open a dialogue if you feel like it.Also – the festival promoters will feel delighted by your effort. All in all its a great way of heading into a solid season.Apart from merely limiting your playlist to acts from the festival, you can also go regional.It takes a little bit of effort, but you can check out local acts and bands and create a „home town“ playlist for the festival.Basically that’s the digital pendant to exclaiming on stage how beautiful and special the city is. A way of actually showing your interest in a productive manner!Recording certain live performances and adding the festival or location where the recording was made is a great take-away for everyone involved.Make sure you have the proper permission, of course.This way you can extend the live experience, maybe even exciting fans of other regions and festivals.Its great to see how certain songs work live – sometimes you’ll even witness some surprises.Keep in mind the tracks that work especially well on a streaming level, and see if that’s the same case when playing them live.Displaying your whole musical periphery – including fun insights on the road – is great content just waiting to be harnessed.You can use Shazam to share some songs you pick up while listening to local radio, or create an on-the-road playlist for the bus.You can even go wild and ask which song might be a good match for a potential cover-version.Get creative and see how heavily you can involve your fanbase! commentsYour email address will not be published.
