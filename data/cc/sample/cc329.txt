If you’re an artist trying to get a feature on an important blog or playlist, this endeavor can turn into quite an unnerving task. Especially if you’re not getting a response for a piece of art you worked your ass off for.Here’s where SubmitHub comes into play. For those of you who have never tried it, it’s basically a structured funnel between artists, managements and labels on one side and blogs, playlists and channels (YouTube, SoundCloud) on the other.One submission costs between $1 and $3. This, consequently, gives blog-owners a professional perspective and the opportunity to spend a certain amount of time on each submission. For artists it is a fast response-system, which involves individual messages of approval or reasons of decline.We’re giving away 5×30 SubmitHub credits right here! Jason Grishkoff, founder of SubmitHub and Indie Shuffle, was kind enough to share some pointers that will help you to get the most out of your next campaign.  It’s usually a good idea to try line up a “premiere” about two weeks before the release. Premieres greatly increase your chances of getting coverage because you’re offering bloggers the chance to be the “first” to reveal your song.  Once you’ve lined up a premiere partner, you’ve then got 1-2 weeks to try and secure additional blog coverage for once the song is out.  Blogs are used to getting songs a week or two in advance.  For playlisters, I’d wait until the song is actually available on Spotify before contacting them.The more the merrier! Bloggers still prefer SoundCloud, but are often happy to go with YouTube as well.  These days a distribution service such as Spinnup will help you get your song onto all platforms with the click on a few buttons.Generally speaking, they do help increase your chances of getting coverage.For me, it’s all down to the song itself.  Social presence, artwork and photography don’t matter as much. If the song is good, I’ll blog it.Yeah, you’ve got nothing to lose!For sure. I’ve compiled a pretty thorough strategy guide here. SubmitHub is part of the ForTunes feed. So you’re able to see the results of your campaigns rollin’ directly onto your mobile device! commentsYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *
