Jack Nova is an aspiring music producer based in Tel Aviv who has already released tracks on labels like Baikonur Recordings or Kontor Records.We had a chat with the up and coming producer about keeping the focus on the music, his favorite production tools and much more. Read on!It started all the way back when I was 6 … When my Mom sent me to play the clarinet. I was a classical player for 12 years, but during that period when I was 14 years old, I started to manage the school sound team and working at school parties, and that’s where it all began. My biggest influences started from DR.DRE, Daft Punk, Oliver Giacomott and Above & Beyond, who’s TATW podcast I’ve been listening to weekly for a long period of time! Today I’m mainly focusing on Pop, Hip Hop and R&B music. For me as a producer, mostly I think I changed the way I look at the industry, and my taste of music has completely changed … Oh and of course I learned a lot production wise. Mostly I educated myself more on
the business side of the music. Knowing and
understanding your rights are the most important things today, since
independent artists have more tools to develop themselves.I actually do all of those, and I don’t think there is any “right way” to actually release your music … We can see artists get to the top of Spotify playlists and charts just by releasing their music independently, and some are doing great with labels as with DIY. Somehow I shifted to something else in this question… 🙂Never know where it starts and where it ends 🙂Mostly musicians focus on how they look online and on
the sound of their tracks, and waste their time with memes instead of
tweaking dat BASS.Timbaland, and I think that’s all. I’m not really “following” them on Instagram.Follow JACK NOVA and make sure to listen to all of his tracks:SpotifySoundCloudInstagramFacebookTwitter commentsYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *
