The wave of Vienna based rock group The Crispies appears to be continuously getting bigger and bigger. After releasing their debut album “Death Row Kids” in 2016, they followed up with “Fake Leather” earlier this year. It has become entirely clear, that their brand cannot be categorized within the classical rock segment. It might better be described as a new wave of emo-rap hitting the airwaves, as the likes of Lil Peep, Trippie Redd or Juice WRLD.We had the chance to ask them a few questions:??? Give the crowd something to remember. We’re not really big fans of redoing the same joke at every show, so for each show we try to find new topics to bring up when talking to the crowd and the funniest stuff comes up this way. Makes it more personal and apart from the music something else will stick with them. It’s actually the first year that the digital music market took over the physical one in Austria. It turns the whole music industry into a more track based market which has its pros and its cons. For example, you don’t always need to wait half a year for your finished record to be released, you can just choose whenever you want to drop a song. Also whenever you release an album there is a high chance that there will be 1-2 filler songs, so you could get rid of that, which is nice. But then again there are some amazing conceptual albums so it would be a pity if that goes to waste. But the market keeps changing on, what feels like, a daily base, so you never know. Definitely, the next music video we are releasing. We shot 3 days and it all went so smoothly. We are used to having 1-2 catastrophes whenever doing videos because someone always forgets something important but this time it all went according to plan and we can’t wait to put it out 🙂 Humor mostly and realizing that you can’t please everyone. But some of those comments are quite funny, people get creative when they see something they don’t like.????? Knowing your bandmates and also knowing when someone needs to some time alone. But tbh no tour is hassle-free. You spend multiple hours a day together in a tight space and sooner or later you’ll start to annoy each other. Sometimes it’s really best to just let out whatever you think is bothering you at the moment and forget about it the second it’s out because you are on tour and most of the stuff you are arguing about is completely meaningless. It’s just you and your bandmates running on fumes, so you need to blow off some steam every now and then. commentsYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *
