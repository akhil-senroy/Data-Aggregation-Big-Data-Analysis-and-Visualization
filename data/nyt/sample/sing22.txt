The young man delivering pizzas in his run-down neighborhood has learned to relish the quiet kindnesses of community. He meets blight and tribulations with a capacious heart that refuses to give up on wonder, until even this impoverished environment unfolds its flawed splendors, revealing a beauty of near-Romantic intensity. Blues in a major key: Marcus Jackson is that rare post-millennial being — a poet whose truth-telling sings. Selected by Rita DoveI took every hour they offered, deliveringlukewarm pizzas by means of an ’86LeSabre, the back tires almost bald.Managers rarely yelled or wore me outabout moving too slow. When we blunderedorders, most customers understood.My brother worked there too. He was beautiful.I should’ve kissed him, one good forehead kisswhile such a gesture might’ve mattered.Women, shoeless in their doorways, gave meresigned smiles as they paid. Undergraduatesmokers proposed hits of their burning herb.The richest part was when businesswould ebb, and I’d coast the summer streets.The air felt like a cool fruit. The engine blockchurned a sure tune. The rearview caughtmoments of low moons. Time was a tame lakemy hand skimmed from the front of a canoe.
