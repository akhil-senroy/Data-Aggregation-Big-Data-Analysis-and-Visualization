Especially considering that during that same time, only one threatened historic building — RCA Studio A — was saved.As Ms. Renkl eloquently describes, Nashville is in danger of destroying its own history. Instead of providing exemptions to Music Row’s zoning — which ultimately encourages demolitions of small-scale, music-related buildings — the city should adopt incentives to support the music industry on Music Row. Although large companies are routinely awarded incentives to locate or operate in Nashville, no such benefits exist for small music businesses.
