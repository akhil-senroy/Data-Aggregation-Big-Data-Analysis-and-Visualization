By snapping up podcast producers, the streaming service is hoping to stock up on high-profile titles in its rivalry with Apple, which has historically been the top podcasting platform.Podcasts help Spotify in other ways as well. They are relatively cheap to produce, in that way improving the company’s profit margins, and help reduce the service’s reliance on expensive music licensing rights. And popular podcasts can attract a faithful audience of subscribers.The terms of the deal were not disclosed.Parcast, which was founded in 2016 and now has two studios and 20 employees, helps fill a particular niche in Spotify’s lineup: crime and mystery shows. The podcast studio says that seven of its shows have debuted in the top three spots on Apple’s podcast charts.“Crime and mystery podcasts are a top genre for our users, and Parcast has had significant success creating hit series while building a loyal and growing fan base,” Dawn Ostroff, Spotify’s chief content officer, said in a statement.Spotify added that 75 percent of Parcast’s audience are women.“In three years, we have created a production house that has grown exponentially and hit a chord with mystery and true-crime fans, especially women, across all 50 states and around the world,” Max Cutler, Parcast’s founder, said in a statement.The acquisition is expected to close by June 30.
