Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Call the Midwife’ When to watch: Sunday, 8 p.m., PBS (check local listings).Eight seasons in, “Call the Midwife” is still happily chugging along. It’s 1964 now on the show, but that doesn’t much affect how many babies are being born and how many people need compassionate and consistent medical care. If you’ve fallen off the “Midwife” bicycle, I’m happy to report that the show is as big-hearted and sincere as ever. “I know it seems like small potatoes, but it’s the little things that make a community,” a woman huffs on this episode. So true, lady.‘The Chi’ When to watch: Sunday, 10 p.m., Showtime.There are no wasted character moments in this ensemble drama, created by Lena Waithe and set on the South Side of Chicago. People with only two lines still make an impression; at any moment it seems as if a fringe character could become the focus of the episode or of the whole show. The season premiere has Brandon (Jason Mitchell) trying to focus on his taco truck, but as often happens on “The Chi,” a combination of violence, systemic oppression and just plain bad luck keep getting in his way. If you’re looking for something between “The Wire” and “Shameless,” try this.
