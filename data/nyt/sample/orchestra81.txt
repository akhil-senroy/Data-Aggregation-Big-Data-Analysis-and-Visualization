With his win, Mr. Cohen joins a lineup of nine past awardees that includes Sullivan Fortner, Aaron Parks, Dan Tepfer and Aaron Diehl — who have all attained significant renown since winning.The American Pianists Association holds a competition for young musicians every two years, but it alternates between jazz and classical. Mr. Cohen was a finalist the last time it focused on jazz pianists, in 2015, but he lost to Mr. Fortner.“It’s a great honor,” Mr. Cohen said in an interview on Sunday.
