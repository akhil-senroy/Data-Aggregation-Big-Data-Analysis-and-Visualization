Since then, Grande has used the fuel of her tabloid moments for music, earning her first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (“Thank U, Next”) and then another with “7 Rings” last month.This week, the singer is attempting to top the Hot 100 for a third time with the song “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored.” Grande’s craftily dedicated fans even instituted a #Boycott7Rings campaign in the hopes of getting listeners to give more streams and sales to its follow-up.y’all are so insane and funny and i love u. nothings funnier than ‘boycott seven rings’..... i can’t lmao. whatever’s meant to be will be, babies 🌫 i ain’t goin nowhere #thankunext https://t.co/g7kdn4E1PDAccording to Billboard, the 307 million on-demand streams for songs from “Thank U, Next” mark the highest-ever one-week total for a pop album; of the Top 20 largest streaming weeks, “Thank U, Next” is No. 9 and the only non-hip-hop album on the list.Also on this week’s chart, No. 2 and No. 3 are both movie soundtracks: “A Star Is Born,” featuring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is in second place ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday, while “Bohemian Rhapsody” is right behind it.
