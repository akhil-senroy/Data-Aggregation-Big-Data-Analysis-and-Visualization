Last year, Juice WRLD reached the Top 5 twice: first with “Goodbye & Good Riddance,” which went to No. 4, and then with “Wrld on Drugs,” a mixtape released with the rapper Future, which peaked at No. 2.The song “Lucid Dreams,” from “Goodbye,” made Juice WRLD a star of so-called emo rap, and drew particular interest for using a piece of Sting’s 1993 track “Shape of My Heart.” (Sting later remarked that the royalties he earns from “Lucid Dreams” will “put my grandkids through college.”)Also this week, Maren Morris’s new album “Girl” opened at No. 4. Ariana Grande’s “Thank U, Next” holds at No. 2, and Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s soundtrack to “A Star Is Born” remains in third place. Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” is No. 5. Last week’s chart-topper, Hozier’s “Wasteland, Baby!,” fell to No. 25.
