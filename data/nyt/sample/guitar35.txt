But you’ll know there’s more to it when your jaw smashes through the dark crust with a sonic boom; when the particular forms of heat contributed by habanero, black pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, Aleppo pepper, cayenne and Tabasco sauce all start to pile up and reverberate like My Bloody Valentine guitar chords; when the meat gives up juices that swirl with wood smoke. This is, after all, a barbecue place.Blue Smoke, 255 Vesey Street (North End Avenue), Battery Park City, 212-889-2005; and 116 East 27th Street (between Park Avenue South and Lexington Avenue), Kips Bay, 212-477-7733; bluesmoke.com.
