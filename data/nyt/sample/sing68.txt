"It is part and parcel of rugby's ethos and culture."The way the fans behave, it might be loud and it might be raucous but it won't be intimidating.“With the police, I think we have been really successful in explaining to them that the light-touch approach is going to be better,” added Wright. Yoshiya Takesako, Japan 2019 director of security, said the police had been told what to expect from fans and how to react.“Rugby fans may seem scary but they are not,” said Takesako, who has been seconded from the Japanese police.“This has been explained to the police so they have been educated that fans will drink a lot and may sing or be loud but it is not like they will hurt anybody.
