I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Senator Sherrod Brown, a rumpled liberal populist, is out of the 2020 presidential race. And Joe Biden, the great hope of moderates, is (almost) in.Newly elected purple-district Democrats in Congress are pledging to voters back home that they’ll “stay in the center.” Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and national Democratic chairman, is warning the party that talking about things like single-payer health care and the Green New Deal “plays into the Trump campaign’s hands.”And former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado opened his presidential campaign this week by questioning whether “Medicare for all” was “really the right thing.”Welcome to the revenge of the moderates.Since President Trump’s election, an activist liberal wing has taken hold of the Democratic Party. They’ve pushed bold economic, health care and environmental proposals. Some have embraced the term “socialist,” giving fresh fodder to Republican critics, and denounced the richest Americans and biggest corporations. And they’ve dominated the national conversation, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in Congress to Senator Bernie Sanders on the campaign trail.But now, as the 2020 primary field comes into sharper focus, we’re starting to see a resurgence of more moderate, market-oriented Democrats, as they try to re-exert their power in a party they fear is courting political defeat by veering too far left.Mr. Biden, a politician defined by the era of centrist Democratic politics, has his campaign plan nearly in place and seems to be moving toward entering the race in the coming weeks. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and other congressional moderates, like Representatives Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, are making noise about launching their own presidential bids.Those men, along with several other white male moderates who may enter the race, hope to provide a counterweight to the proposals of the Sanders-Warren wing of the party.Of course, in one really big way, the liberals have already won by shifting the debate distinctly leftward. The conversation in the Democratic Party is around their ideas: a massive plan to fight climate change, a complete overhaul of the health care system, new taxes on the ultrarich.Many in the party have embraced these ideas, in part as a reaction to the intractably partisan environment in Washington. Bipartisan, moderate politics feel inadequate for the political moment, liberals argue. And if you can’t cut deals with market-oriented Republicans anyhow, the thinking goes, why not go big and bold?The economist Brad DeLong, a neoliberal who served as deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy in the Clinton administration, has said that centrists like himself should “pass the baton to our colleagues on our left.”Whether Democratic voters agree will be one of the defining questions of the primary.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________Have you heard The Daily?Our morning news podcast, The Daily, is a great way to hear the story behind the biggest stories at The New York Times. If you haven’t listened before — or if you’re a lapsed fan — you might want to try today’s episode: Coral Davenport, who covers energy and the environment for The Times, dives into the details and the politics of the Green New Deal.Listen to the episode here.____________________We’ve written before about the brand of zero-tolerance racial and gender politics Democrats have embraced in the Trump era. What’s happening on Capitol Hill this week with Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota offers perhaps the most high-profile test yet of that policy — and how it interacts with the Democrats’ new power in Washington.For those who haven’t been following the issue, here’s a quick catch-up. Last week, Ms. Omar suggested that pro-Israel activists were pushing “for allegiance to a foreign country” — a comment that leading Jewish lawmakers said played into the anti-Semitic trope of “dual loyalty.” They pressured Speaker Nancy Pelosi to introduce a resolution condemning anti-Semitism.That infuriated a group of younger liberal and minority members, who saw the resolution as unfairly targeting a lawmaker who is not only one of the first Muslim-American women in Congress but also a refugee.The conflict boiled over in a closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Wednesday. What about condemning Islamophobia, demanded the liberal members? What about racism? Homophobia?Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris defended Ms. Omar from the campaign trail. Representative Ayanna Pressley, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts, said: “We need to denounce all forms of hate. There is no hierarchy of hurt.”The messy dispute has dominated Congress for the past week, overshadowing a signature Democratic bill, H.R. 1, designed to send a message about overhauling ethics, lobbying and voting laws. It has also been a boon for Republicans, who have already begun using Ms. Omar as both a symbol of Democratic hypocrisy and a way to give cover for the race-baiting, misogynistic remarks of President Trump.In an effort to end the uproar, the House today approved a resolution on the oh-so-bold position of condemning all hate. One Democratic lawmaker told me this week that they just wanted to take the vote and move on as quickly as possible.It’s not likely to be that easy: Issues of race, gender and immigration dominate our national conversation. Hard to imagine Democrats escaping them — or the passions they provoke.Now we want to hear from you.What do you think about Ms. Omar’s statements and the Democrats’ response?
